## Compilation
`Hello.java` - `javac` (Compiler) -> `Hello.class` - `java` (Interpreter) -> stuff happens

## Defining and Instantiating Classes
**Class Declaration:** Java classes can contain methods and/or variables. These methods and variables are called “members” of the class. Members can be _instance_ members or _static_ members. Static members are declared with the `static` keyword. Instance members are any members without the `static` keyword.
