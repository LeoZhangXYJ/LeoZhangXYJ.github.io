# About

## Who I am 
I am a undergraduate student at ZheJiang University, majoring in Geography Information Science.  

## Why in English

To force myself to practice English

## WorkFlow
I first write notes locally using Obsidian, then push notes to websites, so some markdown syntax is different and needs to be fixed.
